# Hyprland Touch Gestures

> [!WARNING]
> Even though hyprgrass is mostly stable now, there used to be some bugs that render your touch device unusable until you unload the plugin/close Hyprland (https://github.com/horriblename/hyprgrass/issues/27), keep a keyboard in hand the first time you try this. This plugin is still in alpha, expect breakable changes!

Please open an issue if you find any bugs. Feel free to make a feature request if you have a suggestion.

## Features/Roadmap

- [x] Workspace Swipe
- [x] Custom commands
- [x] Swipe From Edge
- [x] Multi-finger swipe

## Installation

### Dependencies

Asides from Hyprland (duh), this plugin has the following dependencies:

```
glm
```

### Install via hyprpm

First, install all [dependencies](#dependencies). Then, run these commands:

```bash
hyprpm add https://github.com/horriblename/hyprgrass
hyprpm enable hyprgrass
```

You can add `exec-once = hyprpm reload -n` to your hyprland config to have plugins loaded at
startup. -n will make hyprpm send a notification if anything goes wrong (e.g. update needed)

see [hyprland wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Plugins/Using-Plugins/#hyprpm) for more info

### Install via Hyprload

(hyprload is deprecated, please use hyprpm instead)

1. install all [dependencies](#dependencies)
2. install hyprload by following the instructions
   [here](https://github.com/Duckonaut/hyprload#Installing)
3. put this in `~/.config/hypr/hyprload.toml`:
   ```
   plugins = [
       "horriblename/hyprgrass",
   ]
   ```
4. run this command:

   ```bash
   # install the plugins
   hyprctl dispatch hyprload install

   # load plugins
   hyprctl dispatch hyprload load
   ```

### Manual compilation

```bash
meson setup build
ninja -C build
```

### Install via nix

Flakes are highly recommended (because I don't know how to do anything without them)

Put this in your `flake.nix` file:

```nix
{
   inputs = {
      # ...
      hyprland.url = "github:hyprwm/Hyprland";
      hyprgrass = {
         url = "github:horriblename/hyprgrass";
         inputs.hyprland.follows = "hyprland"; # IMPORTANT
      };
   };
}
```

and in your home-manager module:

```nix
wayland.windowManager.hyprland = {
   plugins = [
      inputs.hyprgrass.packages.${pkgs.system}.default
   ];
};
```

## Configuration

### Configuration options:

```
plugin {
  touch_gestures {
    # The default sensitivity is probably too low on tablet screens,
    # I recommend turning it up to 4.0
    sensitivity = 1.0

    # must be >= 3
    workspace_swipe_fingers = 3

    # in milliseconds
    long_press_delay = 400

    experimental {
      # send proper cancel events to windows instead of hacky touch_up events,
      # NOT recommended as it crashed a few times, once it's stabilized I'll make it the default
      send_cancel = 0
    }
  }
}
```

#### Other options

I also recommend that you adjust the settings for the built-in gesture to make it easier to switch workspaces:

```
gestures {
  workspace_swipe = true
  workspace_swipe_cancel_ratio = 0.15
}
```

### Custom Commands

You can also bind gesture events to dispatchers, it currently uses the built-in bind keyword like
keybinds. This will likely change in the future.

#### Syntax

```
bind = , <gesture_name>, <dispatcher>, <args>
```

where (skip to [examples](#examples) if this is confusing):

- `gesture_name` is one of:
  1. `swipe:<finger_count>:<direction>`
     - `finger_count` must be >= 3
     - `direction` is one of `l`, `r`, `u`, `d`, or `ld`, `rd`, `lu`, `ru` for diagonal directions.  
       (l, r, u, d stand for left, right, up, down)
  2. `tap:<finger_count>`
     - `finger_count` must be >= 3
  3. `edge:<from_edge>:<direction>`
     - `<from_edge>` is from which edge to start from (l/r/u/d)
     - `<direction>` is in which direction to swipe (l/r/u/d/lu/ld/ru/rd)
  4. `longpress:<finger_count>`

#### Examples

```
# swipe left from right edge
bind = , edge:r:l, workspace, +1

# swipe up from bottom edge
bind = , edge:d:u, exec, firefox

# swipe down from left edge
bind = , edge:l:d, exec, pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -4%

# swipe down with 4 fingers
# NOTE: swipe events only trigger for finger count of >= 3
bind = , swipe:4:d, killactive

# swipe diagonally left and down with 3 fingers
# l (or r) must come before d and u
bind = , swipe:3:ld, exec, foot

# tap with 3 fingers
# NOTE: tap events only trigger for finger count of >= 3
bind = , tap:3, exec, foot

# longpress can trigger mouse binds:
bindm = , longpress:2, movewindow
bindm = , longpress:3, resizewindow
```
